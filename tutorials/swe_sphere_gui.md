This tutorial describes the output files generated by the shallow-water equations on the sphere

* We start by loading the SWEET environment:
```
$ . ./local/env_vars.sh
```

* Remove existing binaries
```
$ make clean
```

* Compile swe_sphere program for the shallow-water equations on the sphere including the visualization
```
$ scons --program=swe_sphere --gui=enable
```

* Execute program with the following parameters:
```
$ ./build/swe_sphere_*_release --timestepping-method=lg_irk_lc_n_erk --timestepping-order=2 --dt=600 -t 864000 -M 128 --benchmark-name=galewsky -v 2
```
Here, the meaning of the parameters is as follows:
	* ```--timestepping-method=lg_irk_lc_n_erk --timestepping-order=2 --dt=600```

		2nd order strang split method: Linear gravity modes are treated implicitly, the rest explicitly

	* ```-t 864000```

		Run for 7 days

	* ```-M 128```

		Spectral resolution of 128

	* ```--benchmark-name=galewsky```
		Choose Galewsky benchmark

	* ```-v 2```

		Be a little bit more verbose

You can cycle throught the different fields for visualization by pressing 'v' (forward) and 'V' (backwards)
and change the visualization style by pressing 'b'/'B'
